Ultimately, crypto draws people towards a current outside of, and away from, legacy institutions. Given the universality of desired alternatives by crypto users, whose ideologies and visions can differ along geographical, cultural, and political divides, this crowd ends up radically heterogenous, even inconsistent at times, desiring their own goals and objectives from multiple vantage points.
